# College Completion kNN Model

This project builds and evaluates k-Nearest Neighbors classification models
to predict institutional graduation and retention outcomes using college-level data.

The workflow includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- kNN model training
- Hyperparameter tuning (k and threshold)
- Confusion matrix evaluation
- Comparison across multiple target variables

Results show that institutional characteristics contain meaningful predictive
information about both graduation and retention performance.
